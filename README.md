# TRS-80 Model 4 - Parts

This project includes various items that were part of a TRS-80 Model 4 and have been replicated for 3D printing. Over time, things get lost or break, and this repository was created to provide a way to recover these lost items. The entire project is available under the MIT license.

Below is a list of available items, each with a link to a more detailed description and the STL file. If there is an item missing that you need, see the note at the end of this file.
